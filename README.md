The program was created with the support of the National Cancer Center.

The program was written on the advice of Yuh-Seog Jung, Jungirl Seok, boyul hwang medical doctor.

Create a ROI 2D image with the NCC BETA program here and show the 3D object 

as a screenshot on the screen with the 3D tool.

This program is based on VTK and

"If the 2D image conforms to the format of VTK in order, it can operate independently" 

and an object-oriented design pattern is applied.
